This project is a Travel Form Web Application developed using PHP and MySQL, focused on collecting travel details and storing them in a database. The application includes a simple and clean landing page that introduces the project and provides access to the travel form.

The travel form allows users to enter basic travel-related information such as personal details, destination, and travel preferences. After submission, the data is directly sent to the server using PHP and saved into a MySQL database. This project does not include form validation, update, or delete functionality. Its main purpose is to demonstrate basic backend connectivity and form data handling.

The front-end of the project is created using HTML and CSS, ensuring a neat and user-friendly interface. The backend logic is handled with PHP, which manages the database connection and inserts form data into MySQL tables. The project follows a straightforward structure, making it easy to understand for beginners who are learning PHP and database integration.

This project is suitable for students and entry-level developers who want hands-on experience with:

PHP form submission

MySQL database connection

Inserting form data into a database

Creating a basic landing page

The project can be enhanced in the future by adding features such as form validation, admin dashboards, or data management options. Overall, it serves as a simple and practical example of using PHP and MySQL together in a real-world web application, making it ideal for learning and demonstrating basic web development skills for beginners.
